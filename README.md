## Overview of the Analysis

Pyber is a ride sharing service that operates in three city types: urban, suburban, and rural. Additional metrics such as total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver by each type of city were calculated. A multi-line graph was also created to show total fares by city type over time. 

## Results

Below is the summary table of Pyberâ€™s metrics across urban, suburban, and rural cities. The number of rides are the highest in urban areas, followed by suburban and rural. The total number of drivers and total fares follow the same pattern. The average fare per ride and per driver were highest in rural areas.

The line graph below shows the fares for each type of city over time. Fares peaked for all city types towards the end of February.

## Summary

The number of urban city rides are the highest. Expansion in the urban cities such as increasing fare rates would be profitable. Additionally, Pyber may consider decreasing the number of total drivers. Only 1,625 rides were made, which suggest that not all drivers provided a ride. Finally, if more data are available, Pyber can do some additional analysis to understand time of day when people require ride sharing, most popular locations within the urban areas, so they can further strategize on how to make the ride sharing business more profitable.
